# **RELATIVE GRADING SYSTEM**
##INTRODUCTION
The relative grading system in universities is a method of evaluating students' performance in comparison to their peers. Instead of assessing students' absolute scores or achievements, relative grading ranks students based on their performance relative to the rest of the class. Here's how it typically works:
1. Distribution of grades: In a relative grading system, grades are assigned based on a predetermined distribution. This distribution can be a bell curve or any other predefined pattern. The purpose is to assign a fixed percentage of students to each grade category.

2. Comparison to peers: After all the students' scores have been obtained, the scores are sorted in descending order to determine the highest and lowest scores in the class. These scores set the benchmark for the grading scale.

3. Determining grade boundaries: The distribution of grades is then applied to the sorted scores. Grade boundaries are established based on the distribution percentages. For example, the top 10% of students may receive an 'A', the next 20% a 'B', and so on.

4. Assigning grades: Each student is assigned a grade based on their position in the sorted list and the determined grade boundaries. Students who perform better than the majority of their peers receive higher grades, while those who perform worse receive lower grades.

This program uses the following distribution of grades that follows a standard 10 point scale:
* Top 10%: S
* Next 20%: A
* Next 30%: B
* Next 25%: C
* Next 15%: F
